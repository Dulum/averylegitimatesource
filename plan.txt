Plan:
make a website for fake articles and scientific studies.
any user can submit a file (pdf maybe?) of a study, and it is automaticcaly added. I want there to be a search engine for articles submitted, and a way of citing other articles from the website.

Tools I need to know probably:
login with google.
SQL based database for the articles.
frontend with react and bootstrap.
server with flask.
